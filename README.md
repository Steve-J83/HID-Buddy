# companion-module-hid-buddy

HID USB Companion module for Raspberry Pi 4 to act as a keyboard. Extends companion functionality to act as a peripheral and send multi key macros/shortcuts via a USB connection. 

Setup to power via USB host power possible (USB 3 800ma). Should function through KVMs (untested)
